                    Started in the year 1955 as Civil Engineering School and later developed as Allahabad Polytechnic in the year 1962 with various Engineering and Management Programmes. Along with its contribution towards upliftment of rural masses, it was upgraded as Institute of Engineering & Rural Technology. In the year 1982, it was awarded “Academic Autonomy” by U.P. state Governament and has established itself as a premier Institution.It was the first polytechnic to be started in Asia. The state Government awarded the status of grant in aid to the institute in 1962.<br/>

Based upon the established excellent credential, the State Government and AICTE permitted the institute to start degree courses in the year 2001. Institute offers B.Tech courses in seven streams;Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Electronics Engineering, Instrumentation and Control Egineering, Mechanical Engineering, Industrial & Production Engineering & Computer Science Engineering
			<br/>At present, Institute is running  three years Engineering Diploma in 13 branches of engineering : Civil Engineering, Civil Engineering with specialization in Construction Technology, Civil Engineering with specialization in Public Healthe Engineering, Electrical Engineering , Electronics Engineering , Instrumentation and Control Egineering, Mechanical Engineering with specialization in Auto Mobile Engineering, Power Plant Engineering, Production Engineering, Refrigeration and Air conditioning Engineering, Tool Engineering, Tube well Engineering& Plastic Technology. Two Years Management Diploma in 3 branches of management: Commercial Practice, Marketing Management and Material Management and one & half year Post Diploma in Computer Application. The instutite awards the diploma in equivalent to the diploma awarded by the Board of Technical Education, Uttar Pradesh
			<br/>Diploma in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in Auto Mobile Engineering, Power Plant Engineering, Production Engineering, Refrigeration and Air conditioning Engineering, Tool Engineering, Tube well Engineering is equivalent to the Diploma in Mechanical Engineering awarded by Board of Technical Education, U.P. Lucknow. Our Pass out students of different specialization in Mechanical Engineering are getting admission for B.Tech courses under the lateral entry scheme of U.P. Technical University (A.K.T.U.) and other Universities. Pass out Students are being engaged by various state government departments, PSUs and Government of India wherever Diploma Engineers in Mechanical Engineering are needed.
